        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          We are Toronto's 1st and only Casual and Competitive Console eSports
          gaming centre, catered to console gamers ONLY! LAN Lords Gaming Centre
          was built on the foundation that gaming with your friends in a LAN
          Party environment should be fun, comfortable, and easy to do. With
          that philosophy in mind, we have developed an experience for the
          Toronto community: LAN Lords Gaming Centre. The two founders of the
          business, Rodney Valerio and Clemens Kim, come from different
          backgrounds and carry different skill sets, but both share a passion
          for gaming. Rodney’s history in LAN gaming dates back to his high
          school days, while Clemens’ started only in 2017. With the help of a
          couple friends, Rodney was able to convince Clemens to get into gaming
          and share the LAN Party experience. This ignited a fire within, which
          eventually led to the idea of opening up a gaming centre that is
          unique yet affordable. LAN Lords Gaming Centre is all about Respect,
          Integrity, Diversity, Quality Experience, Sportsmanship, and last but
          not least, FUN!
